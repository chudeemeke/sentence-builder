## Next Steps

1. **Test Basic Flow**:
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Click through all navigation tabs
   - Try building sentences

2. **Test PWA Features**:
   - Open Chrome DevTools → Application tab
   - Check "Offline" mode - app should still work
   - Look for install prompt in address bar

3. **Customize**:
   - Edit presets in `src/presets/`
   - Modify word banks in `src/utils/word-banks.js`
   - Adjust colors in `src/utils/colors.js`

## Troubleshooting

**If npm install fails:**
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

**If port 5173 is busy:**
```bash
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

**If can't connect from iPad:**
- Make sure on same WiFi
- Check Windows Firewall
- Use Network URL, not localhost
